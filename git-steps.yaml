# before using git, always create a temporary directory and change into it
mkdir tmp && cd tmp

# clone the remote repo, via ssh. This step assumes that you have already created and put your publich ssh keys into your git hub repo

git clone git@github.com:cypriannde/it-ops-git.git

# change into the directory, that you have just cloned
cd it-ops-git

# create the new file or update yours notes
# when you are done, save the file or your work, into your git local repo

# add the untracked work to your local repo's staging stage
git add -A
git add <filename>

# commit the changes to the dev stage
git commit -m "<put your message here>"
