# how to creat a file using the using the (mkdir):
  mkdir : creat a directory (mkdir test)
  ! mkdir test1 test2 test3 test4 
    -v = verbose: when you apply this command (mkdir -v)it tells you if the directory is created or not, but if you dont appluy that command it simply creat the directory without notifying you.
  ! -p: will creat both child and parent directory.
   --> eg mkdir class/c26/c27/c27
    so to creat both parent & child you have to pass the (-p) option. also to know if you have created the file or not you use the (-pv) option and it will tell you have created the various directories. and for you to see the directories you run the (ls command) and all will be displayed.
 tree: list the contents of directories in a tree-like format
 cd: change directory
 rmdir: remove or delete an empty directory 
 rm: it will remove a file or directory.
 rm -r: will remove a directory wether it is empty or not

! commands to creat a file:
   /touch --> (touch it ops.git)
   /echo --> display to you any information that you pass eg (echo class27), it will give you the exact mesage you passed
